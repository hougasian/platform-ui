# Platform UI

Platform UI is a CSS framework, rooted in Sass, used by [Ritter Insurance Marketing](https://ritterim.com) (RIM) for our platform of agent tools. It's being built as a replacement for existing frameworks while considering some of our unique needs.

As we continue to improve Platform UI, we hope to create an easy to use framework that other developers can implement.

## Publishing

Platform UI is published privately on a regular basis to [MyGet](https://myget.org/). More infrequent but stable builds are published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as [@ritterim/platform-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ritterim/platform-ui).

## Styleguide

Documentation for Platform UI is generated on every build using [KSS-Node](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node) and hosted [here](https://style.rimdev.io/).
